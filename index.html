    <h1>HTML Crash Course </h1>
    <h2>Frontend Simplified</h2> 
    <p>Frontend Simplified HTML training course is good for people who want to start learning coding. First we learn that Element names are surrounded by angle brackets. They usually come in pairs but some close themselves.</p>
    <p>H tags and P tags are block tags, they start on a new line and take the full width available.<b> Some Tags</b> such as the bold tag can be used inside other elements as they are inline level tags. Inline level tags dont start on a new line and only take up the necessary space. The <b>Div</b> tag is used to group elements together and has no actual meaning. <i>Italices</i> is another inline level tag.</p>
